### Five Number Summary and Box-Plot

#### **Objective:**
- To understand and apply the five-number summary.
- To create a box plot for visualizing the data distribution.
- To detect and interpret outliers in a dataset.

#### **Instructions:**

1. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - Use the following dataset, or you can generate your own dataset with at least 15 data points:
     ```
     [12, 15, 14, 10, 13, 25, 21, 24, 18, 19, 30, 28, 22, 35, 40]
     ```
   
2. **Calculate the Five-Number Summary:**
   The five-number summary consists of:
   - **Minimum**: The smallest data value.
   - **Q1 (First Quartile)**: The median of the lower half of the dataset (excluding the median if odd number of data points).
   - **Median (Q2)**: The middle value of the dataset.
   - **Q3 (Third Quartile)**: The median of the upper half of the dataset.
   - **Maximum**: The largest data value.

3. **Box Plot Creation:**
   - Create a box plot for the dataset.
   - Label the quartiles, the median, and any outliers on the box plot.
   
5. **Report:**
   - Submit a report containing:
     - The five-number summary.
     - A screenshot of the box plot.
     - The identified outliers (if any).
     - A brief explanation of why the outliers were identified.
